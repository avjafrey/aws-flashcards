# aws-flashcards

This is a set of [Flashcard Hero](http://flashcardhero.com/) decks that I've created to help prepare for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) exam. There's a primary deck and another with just service limits. I split out the limits because they are more difficult to memorize (I never really did myself) and in hindsight less important than the other material. Regardless you may want to review them anyway.

Please note that I created these decks *before* I took the exam. In hindsight, many of the cards didn't come up. Nonetheless, I definitely got a lot of value in creating the decks, so I'm publishing them in the hopes that others will find them useful as well.

Note that I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for errors in the decks, although please let me know if you find any and I'll make corrections. Using this deck DOES NOT IN ANY WAY GUARANTEE that you'll pass the exam. The time you spend reviewing these cards should be a fraction of the effort you'll spend actually preparing for the exam.
